# HTTP-Server

Steps to cover : 
1. Create a socket
2. Bind the socket to an address
3. Listen on the address
4. Block on Accept until a connection is made
5. Read on the connected socket
6. Figure out how to respond
7. Write back on the connected socket
8. Close the connection
9. Go back to blocking on Accept

Let us move to Step 1
## How to Create a Socket in C

Before moving forward, let us understand what a "socket" is?

A socket is like a "doorway" for communication between processes or devices.

A socket can be created using sys/socket.h header file.

Let us start by initializing the socket first. To create a socket in C, you use the function:
```C
int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol)
```

Here,
- **sockfd**: This is a number (integer) that acts like a label for your socket. Think of it like a "file handle" for a file, but for communication instead of file operations.

- **domain**: integer,  This decides where the communication happens:

    - AF_LOCAL: Communication between processes on the same computer (POSIX standard).
    - AF_INET: Communication using IPv4 (e.g., between devices over a network).
    - AF_INET6: Communication using IPv6.

- **type**: This decides how data is sent:
    - SOCK_STREAM: Uses TCP, which ensures data arrives in order and without errors (reliable, connection-oriented).
    - SOCK_DGRAM: Uses UDP, which is faster but doesnâ€™t guarantee reliability or order (unreliable, connectionless).
- **protocol**: Usually set to 0, it specifies the protocol used within the chosen domain. For example, in AF_INET, 0 defaults to IP.

### A little more on Sockets

The value of sockfd (the socket file descriptor) depends on the success or failure of the socket() function call:

- If the socket() function call is **successful**, sockfd will be a **positive integer**. It represents the file descriptor for the newly created socket. File descriptors typically start from 0 and increase, *but 0 is usually reserved for standard input (stdin)*, so a socket's file descriptor will generally be **1 or higher**.
- If the socket() function call **fails**, it **returns -1**. This indicates an error, and you should check errno (a global variable) to determine the reason for the failure.
